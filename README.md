# Password Generator Website

## Description

This website is a password generator. After a list of options for the user to choose from, it will create a password that satisfies the requirements, such as having an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special character. My motivation for this project came from me wanting to create a random generator. Randomness is always fun, and a password generator seemed like the perfect start. I built this project because I am one of those people that only use 1 password, but change the numbers or add special characters to the end of it to spice things up, and this could help me use more passwords, as long as I remember them or write them down in a folder. This was my first time creating a random generator, and using the combination of math.floor() coupled with math.random() helped me learn how to code in random generators for potential other projects. This generator could possibly be used for people like me who want to spice things up and not stick with the same password for all of their secure and important information.

To use this website, simply click the generate password button. From there, you will be met with a series of prompts that first ask how long will the password be.(friendly-parakeet/Assets:images/passwordLength.png) The next series of prompts ask the user about the criteria of the password, whether you want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters. (friendly-parakeet/Assets:images/IncludeLetters.png) Finally the generated password appears in the white box.
